Creating a monolithic architecture for a social media application would involve combining all the services into a single codebase with a unified backend. Here's how the same features could be structured in a monolith using Go (Gin) and PostgreSQL:

---

## **Monolithic Social Media Application Architecture**  

### **Core Modules:**  

1. **Authentication Module:**  
   - Manages user login, registration, logout, password reset, and token generation.  
   - Tech Stack: Go (Gin), PostgreSQL (user credentials).  
   - Endpoints:  
     - POST /auth/register  
     - POST /auth/login  
     - POST /auth/logout  
     - POST /auth/forgot-password  
     - POST /auth/reset-password  

2. **User Profile Module:**  
   - Manages user details (bio, profile picture, education, etc.).  
   - Tech Stack: Go (Gin), PostgreSQL (user profiles).  
   - Endpoints:  
     - GET /users/:id  
     - PUT /users/:id  
     - DELETE /users/:id  

3. **Post Module:**  
   - Manages post creation, editing, deletion, and multimedia uploads.  
   - Tech Stack: Go (Gin), PostgreSQL (posts).  
   - Endpoints:  
     - POST /posts  
     - GET /posts/:id  
     - DELETE /posts/:id  

4. **Feed Module:**  
   - Displays user feeds based on different algorithms (chronological, trending).  
   - Tech Stack: Go (Gin), PostgreSQL (feed data).  
   - Endpoints:  
     - GET /feed  
     - GET /feed/trending  

5. **Comments & Reactions Module:**  
   - Manages comments, likes, shares, and reactions.  
   - Tech Stack: Go (Gin), PostgreSQL (comments, reactions).  
   - Endpoints:  
     - POST /posts/:id/comment  
     - POST /posts/:id/like  
     - DELETE /posts/:id/like  

6. **Notifications Module:**  
   - Sends notifications for likes, comments, and follows.  
   - Tech Stack: Go (Gin), PostgreSQL (notifications).  
   - Endpoints:  
     - GET /notifications  
     - PUT /notifications/mark-as-read  

7. **Connections Module:**  
   - Manages follows, friend requests, and connections.  
   - Tech Stack: Go (Gin), PostgreSQL (relationships).  
   - Endpoints:  
     - POST /users/:id/follow  
     - POST /users/:id/unfollow  
     - POST /users/:id/friend-request  

8. **Messaging Module:**  
   - Handles real-time chats between users.  
   - Tech Stack: Go (Gin), PostgreSQL (messages).  
   - Endpoints:  
     - POST /messages/send  
     - GET /messages/conversation/:id  

9. **Search Module:**  
   - Provides search functionality for users, posts, hashtags, and groups.  
   - Tech Stack: Go (Gin), PostgreSQL (search data), Elasticsearch (optional).  
   - Endpoints:  
     - GET /search  

10. **Media Module:**  
    - Manages file storage for profile pictures, posts, and media uploads.  
    - Tech Stack: Go (Gin), AWS S3 (optional), PostgreSQL (media metadata).  

11. **Groups & Communities Module:**  
    - Manages groups, posts within groups, and group memberships.  
    - Tech Stack: Go (Gin), PostgreSQL (groups data).  
    - Endpoints:  
      - POST /groups  
      - GET /groups/:id  
      - POST /groups/:id/join  

12. **Admin & Moderation Module:**  
    - Manages admin tasks like moderating content and banning users.  
    - Tech Stack: Go (Gin), PostgreSQL (admin logs).  
    - Endpoints:  
      - POST /moderation/posts/:id  
      - POST /moderation/users/:id  

13. **Analytics Module:**  
    - Tracks platform engagement, post interactions, and active users.  
    - Tech Stack: Go (Gin), PostgreSQL (analytics data).  
    - Endpoints:  
      - GET /analytics/posts  
      - GET /analytics/users  

14. **Payments Module (Optional):**  
    - Manages transactions for premium services or ads.  
    - Tech Stack: Go (Gin), PostgreSQL (transactions).  
    - Endpoints:  
      - POST /payments/charge

### **Infrastructure Components:**  

1. **API Gateway:**  
   - Not needed in a monolith as the application itself is the entry point.  

2. **Database:**  
   - PostgreSQL: Centralized database with properly normalized tables.  

3. **Caching Service:**  
   - Redis: For caching frequently accessed data (e.g., feeds).  

4. **Message Queue:**  
   - Kafka/RabbitMQ: For asynchronous event processing (optional).  

5. **File Storage Service:**  
   - AWS S3 or local storage for managing media uploads.  

6. **Search Indexing:**  
   - Elasticsearch: For optimized search (if required).

### **Monolith Deployment Considerations:**  
- Use Docker for containerization.  
- Use Kubernetes or Docker Compose for scaling.  
- Follow a layered architecture:  
  - **Handlers:** Manage HTTP requests.  
  - **Services:** Implement business logic.  
  - **Repositories:** Handle database operations.  
  - **Models:** Define data structures.
